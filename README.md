## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

### The Gaming Room was a fictional client requesting help deploying their existing android game Draw it or Lose it as a web application across multiple platforms. The Gaming Room    requested that:

+ A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.

+ Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.

+ Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.

+ Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

### + I think I did a good job in identifying a framework that could be a good solution to the problem of having to develop for different platforms in one place, React native.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

### + I think having documentation that outlined the development from a macro level helps to govern micro decisions. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

### + I think a better description of storage management techniques could help.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

### + I used the client requests to make design decisions. Had the request been for a specific platform the development considerations would change, because the client requested a multiplatform design the design changes.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

### + I think it is very important to understand physical resource requirements on the client and server side and design in a way that will work for the paricular use case.
