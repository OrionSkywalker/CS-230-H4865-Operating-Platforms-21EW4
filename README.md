>>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   The Gaming Room was a fictional client requesting help deploying their existing android game Draw it or Lose it as a web application across multiple platforms. The Gaming Room    requested that:
      *A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
      *Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
      *Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
      *Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.
